front-desc: torchsynth is based upon traditional modular synthesis written in pytorch. It is GPU-optional and differentiable. Most synthesizers are fast in terms of latency. torchsynth is fast in terms of throughput. It synthesizes audio 16200x faster than realtime (714MHz) on a single GPU. This is of particular interest to audio ML researchers seeking large training corpora.
