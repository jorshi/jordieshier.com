I am PhD student in the [Artificial Intelligence and Music](https://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk/)
(AIM) programme based at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL). My supervisors are
[Prof. Andrew McPherson](http://instrumentslab.org/) and [Dr. Charalampos Saitis](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/profiles/saitischaralampos.html).
Our industry research partner is Dr. Andrew Robertson ([Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/)).

My research is focused on the development of software that supports creativity
in musicians and music producers. I am particularly interested creating novel
methods for synthesizing audio and researching new interaction paradigms for music
synthesizers. My PhD research topic is
[Real-time timbral mapping for synthesized percussive performance](https://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk/phd-topics/#Ableton).

Previously, I completed a Master's degree at the University of Victoria with
Prof. George Tzanetakis and Assoc. Prof. Kirk McNally.

Beyond research, I love creating music and exploring sounds, especially using modular synthesizers.
When I'm not at a computer or tinkering with synths I like to climb rocks and ride bikes.
