  abstract={Timbre remapping is an approach to audio-to-synthesizer parameter mapping that aims to transfer timbral expressions from a source instrument onto synthesizer controls. This process is complicated by the ill-defined nature of timbre and the complex relationship between synthesizer parameters and their sonic output. In this work, we focus on real-time timbre remapping with percussion instruments, combining technical development with practice-based methods to address these challenges. As a technical contribution, we introduce a genetic algorithm—applicable to black-box synthesizers including VSTs and modular synthesizers—to generate datasets of synthesizer presets that vary according to target timbres. Additionally, we propose a neural network-based approach to predict control features from short onset windows, enabling low-latency performance and featurebased control. Our technical development is grounded in musical practice, demonstrating how iterative and collaborative processes can yield insights into open-ended challenges in DMI design. Experiments on various audio representations uncover meaningful insights into timbre remapping by coupling data-driven design with practice-based reflection. This work is accompanied by an annotated portfolio, presenting a series of musical performances and experiments with reflections.},

  abstract={We here outline the concept design of an augmented percussion instrument, conceived for and used as part of a variety of distinct performances and compositions. Throughout the curation of this project, each creative act has enabled us to contextualise, examine and reflect upon the design of this augmented instrument. In accordance with Stolterman and Wiberg’s concept driven design methodology, we do not present a singular instrument design, but instead an overarching design concept alongside its developmental and evaluative narrative. This augmentation centres upon the use of a drum trigger and a tactile transducer, which when coupled together can be used to feedback or resonate a drum. The resultant soundworld develops upon the idiomatic sonority of a drum, and allows for the duration and timbre of a drum strike to be continuously manipulated and shaped throughout a performance. In exploring the soundworld which results from this approach, we have experimented with numerous configurations of these pieces of hardware, and have also employed various pieces of software to parametrise the sonic subtleties that this approach engenders. Most prominently, we have developed a bespoke piece of software which analyses the modes of a drum prior to performance, and uses this modal analysis to shape the overall feedback and resonance. Throughout this design process, we have consistently been met with new creative criteria that challenge our approach and ideas, in response to the particularities of the musicians we are working alongside, as well as the performative and aesthetic environments we are working within.},

  title={Designing Neural Synthesizers for Low Latency Interaction},

  abstract={Neural Audio Synthesis (NAS) models offer interactive musical control over high-quality, expressive audio generators. While these models can operate in real-time, they often suffer from high latency, making them unsuitable for intimate musical interaction. The impact of architectural choices in deep learning models on audio latency remains largely unexplored in the NAS literature. In this work, we investigate the sources of latency and jitter typically found in interactive NAS models. We then apply this analysis to the task of timbre transfer using RAVE, a convolutional variational autoencoder for audio waveforms introduced by Caillon et al. in 2021. Finally, we present an iterative design approach for optimizing latency. This culminates with a model we call BRAVE (Bravely Realtime Audio Variational autoEncoder), which is low-latency and exhibits better pitch and loudness replication while showing timbre modification capabilities similar to RAVE. We implement it in a specialized inference framework for low-latency, real-time inference and present a proof-of-concept audio plugin compatible with audio signals from musical instruments. We expect the challenges and guidelines described in this document to support NAS researchers in designing models for low-latency inference from the ground up, enriching the landscape of possibilities for musicians.},

  abstract = {Timbre is a nuanced yet abstractly defined concept. Its inherently subjective qualities make it challenging to design and work with. In this paper, we propose to explore the conceptualisation and negotiation of timbre within the creative practice of timbre tool makers. To this end, we hosted a hackathon event and performed an ethnographic study to explore how participants engaged with the notion of timbre and how their conception of timbre was shaped through social interactions and technological encounters. We present individual descriptions of each team’s design process and reflect on our data to identify commonalities in the ways that timbre is understood and informed by sound technologies and their surrounding sonic cultures, e.g., by relating concepts of timbre to metaphors. We further current understanding by offering novel interdisciplinary and multimodal insights into understandings of timbre.},

  abstract={Timbre is a primary mode of expression in diverse musical contexts. However, prevalent audio-driven synthesis methods predominantly rely on pitch and loudness envelopes, effectively flattening timbral expression from the input. Our approach draws on the concept of timbre analogies and investigates how timbral expression from an input signal can be mapped onto controls for a synthesizer. Leveraging differentiable digital signal processing, our method facilitates direct optimization of synthesizer parameters through a novel feature difference loss. This loss function, designed to learn relative timbral differences between musical events, prioritizes the subtleties of graded timbre modulations within phrases, allowing for meaningful translations in a timbre space. Using snare drum performances as a case study, where timbral expression is central, we demonstrate real-time timbre remapping from acoustic snare drums to a differentiable synthesizer modeled after the Roland TR-808.},

  abstract={The term “differentiable digital signal processing” describes a family of techniques in which loss function gradients are backpropagated through digital signal processors, facilitating their integration into neural networks. This article surveys the literature on differentiable audio signal processing, focusing on its use in music and speech synthesis. We catalogue applications to tasks including music performance rendering, sound matching, and voice transformation, discussing the motivations for and implications of the use of this methodology. This is accompanied by an overview of digital signal processing operations that have been implemented differentiably, which is further supported by a web book containing practical advice on differentiable synthesiser programming (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://intro2ddsp.github.io/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://intro2ddsp.github.io/</ext-link>). Finally, we highlight open challenges, including optimisation pathologies, robustness to real-world conditions, and design trade-offs, and discuss directions for future research.}

  abstract = {Differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) techniques, including methods for audio synthesis, have gained attention in recent years and lend themselves to interpretability in the parameter space. However, current differentiable synthesis methods have not explicitly sought to model the transient portion of signals, which is important for percussive sounds. In this work, we present a unified synthesis framework aiming to address transient generation and percussive synthesis within a DDSP framework. To this end, we propose a model for percussive synthesis that builds on sinusoidal modeling synthesis and incorporates a modulated temporal convolutional network for transient generation. We use a modified sinusoidal peak picking algorithm to generate time-varying non-harmonic sinusoids and pair it with differentiable noise and transient encoders that are jointly trained to reconstruct drumset sounds. We compute a set of reconstruction metrics using a large dataset of acoustic and electronic percussion samples that show that our method leads to improved onset signal reconstruction for membranophone percussion instruments.}

  abstract={What audio embedding approach generalizes best to a wide range of downstream tasks across a variety of everyday domains without fine-tuning? The aim of the HEAR benchmark is to develop a general-purpose audio representation that provides a strong basis for learning in a wide variety of tasks and scenarios. HEAR evaluates audio representations using a benchmark suite across a variety of domains, including speech, environmental sound, and music. HEAR was launched as a NeurIPS 2021 shared challenge. In the spirit of shared exchange, each participant submitted an audio embedding model following a common API that is general-purpose, open-source, and freely available to use. Twenty-nine models by thirteen external teams were evaluated on nineteen diverse downstream tasks derived from sixteen datasets. Open evaluation code, submitted models and datasets are key contributions, enabling comprehensive and reproducible evaluation, as well as previously impossible longitudinal studies. It still remains an open question whether one single general-purpose audio representation can perform as holistically as the human ear.},

  abstract={The use of electronic drum samples is widespread in contemporary music productions, with music producers having an unprecedented number of samples available to them. The task of organizing and selecting from these large collections can be challenging and time consuming, which points to the need for improved methods for user interaction. This paper presents a system that computationally characterizes and organizes drum machine samples in two dimensions based on sound similarity. The goal of the work is to support the development of intuitive drum sample browsing systems. The methodology presented explores time segmentation, which isolates temporal subsets from the input signal prior to audio feature extraction, as a technique for improving similarity calculations. Manifold learning techniques are compared and evaluated for dimensionality reduction tasks, and used to organize and visualize audio collections in two dimensions. This methodology is evaluated using a combination of objective and subjective methods including audio classification tasks and a user listening study. Finally, we present an open-source audio plug-in developed using the JUCE software framework that incorporates the findings from this study into an application that can be used in the context of a music production environment.},
